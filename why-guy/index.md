<h2>Nomination of Guy de Faye as Candidate for Senator</h2>

<h3>Sep 2014</h3>

I am **Michael Millar** and I am very pleased to propose **Guy William John de Faye** as a candidate in the forthcoming election for Senators.

Guy has extensive experience of States matters, having served for 6 years as a Deputy in St Helier.

He was the only Deputy to be elected to the original Council of Ministers, where he took on the role of Minister for Transport and Technical Services.

Since he left the States, Guy has created a consultancy for Islanders who have difficulties with their government. He has seen through planning applications, advised on responding to consultation processes and tackled unfair bureaucracy.

It will come as no surprise that he has been pretty busy. This “game keeper turned poacher” line of work has given Guy a wide insight into how Jersey’s government has developed in recent years.

Guy has an inventive eye for detail and, whilst at TTS, was personally responsible for the appearance of the hugely popular beach showers around the Island. He also initiated the highly successful Jersey Heritage holiday lets.

His perceptive innovation was finally recognized when the BBC Coast show filmed a visit to Seymour Tower. The “Coast” series is watched around the world and Guy’s initiative has probably done more for Jersey tourism than anything since.

Guy also promoted improvements in the local bus service, which saw Connex win a Business Enterprise of the Year Award and additionally drove through the largest road re-surfacing project that Jersey has ever undertaken.

Guy’s practical and straightforward approach was apparent when he achieved States’ approval for the Energy from Waste plant - Jersey’s biggest capital project to date. The new plant has proved a success. It produces nearly £2 million pounds worth of electricity per year from our rubbish and is vastly cleaner than its predecessor.

It has become clear that various managerial, policy and structural failures exist across a range of government bodies. This is a primary motivation for Guy seeking re-election – with every intention of “taking a spanner to government workings”.

Although some candidates in the forthcoming election have been content to see the role of Senator brought to an end, Guy is a passionate supporter of the position and will fight for the Island wide mandate to be extended rather than abolished.

Guy’s renowned debating skills are of huge benefit to the States Assembly.

He researches topics and provides intelligent pragmatic solutions, never shying away from difficult or unpopular conclusions when necessary.

Perhaps most importantly for voters, Guy retains and insists on the highest level of probity in public office. He is readily approachable by all sections of the community and can be relied upon to provide common sense and straight talking leadership.

*In difficult economic times I urge islanders to elect him*.

Finally – Mr de Faye has no convictions to declare.
