It has become clear that various managerial, policy and structural failures exist across a range of government bodies. This is a primary motivation for Guy seeking re-election – with every intention of “taking a spanner to government workings”.

Although some candidates in the forthcoming election have been content to see the role of Senator brought to an end, Guy is a passionate supporter of the position and will fight for the Island wide mandate to be extended rather than abolished.

Guy’s renowned debating skills are of huge benefit to the States Assembly.

He researches topics and provides intelligent pragmatic solutions, never shying away from difficult or unpopular conclusions when necessary.

Perhaps most importantly for voters, Guy retains and insists on the highest level of probity in public office. He is readily approachable by all sections of the community and can be relied upon to provide common sense and straight talking leadership.

*In difficult economic times I urge islanders to elect him*.

Finally – Mr de Faye has no convictions to declare.
