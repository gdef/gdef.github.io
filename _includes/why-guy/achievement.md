Guy has an inventive eye for detail and, whilst at TTS, was personally responsible for the appearance of the hugely popular beach showers around the Island. He also initiated the highly successful Jersey Heritage holiday lets.

His perceptive innovation was finally recognized when the BBC Coast show filmed a visit to Seymour Tower. The “Coast” series is watched around the world and Guy’s initiative has probably done more for Jersey tourism than anything since.

Guy also promoted improvements in the local bus service, which saw Connex win a Business Enterprise of the Year Award and additionally drove through the largest road re-surfacing project that Jersey has ever undertaken.

Guy’s practical and straightforward approach was apparent when he achieved States’ approval for the Energy from Waste plant - Jersey’s biggest capital project to date. The new plant has proved a success. It produces nearly £2 million pounds worth of electricity per year from our rubbish and is vastly cleaner than its predecessor.
