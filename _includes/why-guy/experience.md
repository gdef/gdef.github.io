Guy has extensive experience of States matters, having served for 6 years as a Deputy in St Helier.

He was the only Deputy to be elected to the original Council of Ministers, where he took on the role of Minister for Transport and Technical Services.

Since he left the States, Guy has created a consultancy for Islanders who have difficulties with their government. He has seen through planning applications, advised on responding to consultation processes and tackled unfair bureaucracy.

It will come as no surprise that he has been pretty busy. This “game keeper turned poacher” line of work has given Guy a wide insight into how Jersey’s government has developed in recent years.
