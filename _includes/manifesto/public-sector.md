<h2 id="public-sector">Stop the expanding public sector</h2>

I am staggered by the latest figures indicating that Jersey now has over **7,000 public service employees**.

States Members and senior civil servants have to take some responsibility for cutting this back, when the latest figures show our current account is already *minus* **£50 million**.

Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg and the public know little of the real position.

A very highly placed source recently confided to me that Jersey's total debt is considerably more than **£1,000 million**.

Whilst this staggering figure may include outstanding pension fund payments, I want to discover what is actually going on and take serious measures to improve matters.
