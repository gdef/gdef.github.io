<h2 id="tax">Ease the tax</h2>

The global economy remains extremely unstable and the recent recession made life a real struggle for many Islanders.

I do not see salaries in the private sector increasing any time soon, but I believe that lower and middle ranking wage earners need some relief. This can only come from easing the tax burden, albeit temporarily, which can assist in pump priming the local economy.

I favour a new introductory income tax rate of 10% and would favour, as an example, removing import duty on alcohol, where high prices are clearly adversely affecting the pub trade, the hospitality industry and tourism.
