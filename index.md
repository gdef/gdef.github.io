<div class="foreword centered" markdown="1">

Many thanks to all the visitors to this website who gave me a Senatorial vote 
in Jersey's first *General Election 2014*. 

I was hugely encouraged by the very favourable responses I received during the 
*Island hustings tour*, but &mdash; unfortunately &mdash; this did not spread 
to the wider electorate.

I can offer an assurance that keeping the Island wide vote and retaining the
role of Senator &mdash; preferably in greater numbers &mdash; *will* continue.

Sincerely &mdash; <span class="written signature"><em>Guy de Faye</em></span>
