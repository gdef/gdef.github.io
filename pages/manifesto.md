<h2 id="immigration">Immigration</h2>

Everyday the international news indicates that the world is becoming an increasingly dangerous environment. British passport holders who have visited the Middle East could be aid workers or suicide bombers.

Jersey must respond to these potential threats by keeping a tighter check on who is coming to the Island.

Vetting procedures could include the **re-introduction of work permits** and **limits on length of stay** for various nationals, although a "light touch" must be retained for genuine holiday makers..

Tighter immigration controls should also work hand in hand with concerted policies to reduce the Island's population.

To date no serious action has been taken, which means that solutions are going to get progressively tougher.

One potential avenue is reducing the scope for receiving child benefit linked to preferential treatment for housing accommodation.

To avoid hardship, any new measures would not be imposed upon current families.

<h2 id="public-sector">Public sector</h2>

I was astonished recently by statistics indicating that Jersey had over 7,000 public service employees. This was around a thousand more personnel when compared to the total numbers that were States employees when I was a Minister. To date, efforts by the Council of Ministers and senior civil servants to reduce these numbers have produced limited results.

However, alongside spending on public sector salaries, Jersey is facing other serious financial commitments. The new hospital will cost at least £450 Million, which should be linked to a minimum of £200 Million in loans that have been taken out to support Andium (the new Housing Department quango). Add in another £100 Million or so for the outcome of the Liquid Waste Strategy and the approximate £20/30 Million spent on a new police station begins to appear minor spending by comparison. Then there are the States pension funds where, when I last investigated, payments in were not expected to come into balance with outgoings until 2080.

In the light of this massive expenditure, it is hardly surprising that the States of Jersey regularly wastes smaller amounts in the tens and hundreds of thousands of pounds on failed projects or projects that simply don't happen. Not to mention the recent mistaken "double payment" of £1 Million pounds due to one electronic invoice duplicated by a hard copy invoice. No harm done, but tax payers will be left wondering how many other mistakes have gone undetected!

Back in 2014, a highly placed source told me that Jersey's debts exceed £1,000 Million and, since that estimation, the States has yet to resolve the outstanding structural debt in annual revenues.

It is increasingly obvious that we cannot continue to fiddle at the margins, as previously. Our current economic growth model appears to be dysfunctional and I want to be at the forefront of developing a new approach.

<h2 id="tax">Tax</h2>

The global economy remains extremely unstable and the recent recession made life a real struggle for many Islanders.

I do not see salaries in the private sector increasing any time soon, but I believe that lower and middle ranking wage earners need some relief. This can only come from easing the tax burden, albeit temporarily, which can assist in pump priming the local economy.

I favour a new introductory income tax rate of 10% and would favour, as an example, removing import duty on alcohol, where high prices are clearly adversely affecting the pub trade, the hospitality industry and tourism.
