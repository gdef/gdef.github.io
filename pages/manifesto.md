<h2 id="tax">Ease the taxation</h2>

The global economy remains extremely unstable and the recent recession made life a real struggle for many Islanders.

I do not see salaries in the private sector increasing any time soon, but I believe that lower and middle ranking wage earners need some relief. This can only come from easing the tax burden, albeit temporarily, which can assist in pump priming the local economy.

I favour a new introductory income tax rate of 10% and would favour, as an example, removing import duty on alcohol, where high prices are clearly adversely affecting the pub trade, the hospitality industry and tourism.

<h2 id="immigration">Control the ports</h2>

Everyday the international news indicates that the world is becoming an increasingly dangerous environment. British passport holders who have visited the Middle East could be aid workers or suicide bombers.

Jersey must respond to these potential threats by keeping a tighter check on who is coming to the Island.

Vetting procedures could include the **re-introduction of work permits** and **limits on length of stay** for various nationals, although a "light touch" must be retained for genuine holiday makers..

Tighter immigration controls should also work hand in hand with concerted policies to reduce the Island's population.

To date no serious action has been taken, which means that solutions are going to get progressively tougher.

One potential avenue is reducing the scope for receiving child benefit linked to preferential treatment for housing accommodation.

<h2 id="public-sector">Stop expanding the public sector</h2>

I am staggered by the latest figures indicating that Jersey now has over **7,000 public service employees**.

States Members and senior civil servants have to take some responsibility for cutting this back, when the latest figures show our current account is already *minus* **£50 million**.

Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg and the public know little of the real position.

A very highly placed source recently confided to me that Jersey's total debt is considerably more than **£1,000 million**.

Whilst this staggering figure may include outstanding pension fund payments, I want to discover what is actually going on and take serious measures to improve matters.
