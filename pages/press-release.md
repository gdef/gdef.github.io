It is my intention to “hit the ground running” with a number of proposals that
include a permanent solution to Jersey's morning peak time traffic congestion
and the re­orientation of the Island's utility services, which do not provide
sufficient advantages and benefits to local consumers – eventhough they are
partially or wholly owned by Island residents.

On a longer term basis, I consider that Jersey must confront its ever increasing
population. It has become clear that current and historic policies have failed
and we cannot keep trying to “pour a quart (1.14 litres) into a pint pot (0.57
litres)”.

Jersey has seen only marginal benefits from its association with the European
Economic Community and, subsequently, the E.U. ­so in the light of events in the
United Kingdom, the Island should act to enhance its position.

I am not satisfied with the Council of Ministers declared position of
maintaining the “status quo”. In respect of freedom of movement, Jersey must
adopt policies that will mean “taking control” of our immigration and
population growth, which are now seriously impacting upon our public services.

Controlling immigration will also require a re­assessment of Jersey's economic
model, which is based around continued growth. This is becoming unsustainable
at the same time as our major industry, financial services, is facing renewed
external pressures. I intend to promote alternative and realistic options for
the future of the Island's economy based more closely on its natural resources.

I intend to pursue my straight talking approach.

I sense voters are becoming weary of “stealth taxes” being variously described
as charges, fees, licenses and levies. I consider that increasing tax should be
a last resort and not the convenient and easy option that seems to be
developing. I undertake to provide the alternative and creative thinking that
will, hopefully, take Jersey on a new path to a prosperous future and – perhaps
– raise the level of debate in our parliamentary Assembly.

Please vote Guy de Faye for Senator

Thank you
